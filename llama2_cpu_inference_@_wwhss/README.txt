================================================================================
Answer:
The Holy Spirit is God's divine breath that brings new life to those who are born again through faith in Jesus Christ. Just as the wind blows where it wishes and cannot be controlled, so too is the work of the Holy Spirit beyond human comprehension. While we may not know exactly where the Holy Spirit comes from or where it goes, we can trust that it is at work in the world, bringing about the transformation of those who are born again through faith in Jesus Christ.

Reference text:
John 3:7 Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'
John 3:8 The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.
John 3:9 Nicodemus answered and said to Him, How can these things be?
John 3:10 Jesus answered and said to him, Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not know these things?
John 3:11 Most assuredly, I say to you, We speak what We know and testify what We have seen, and you do not receive Our witness.
John 3:12 If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
